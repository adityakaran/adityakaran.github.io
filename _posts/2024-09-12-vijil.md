Relinking the blog post I wrote at [Vijil](https://medium.com/tech-at-instacart/optimizing-at-the-edge-using-regression-discontinuity-designs-to-power-decision-making-51e296615046) where we enabled scoring against benchmarks (MMLU) by using the [tinyBenchmark] () methodology. Combined with Vijil engine, we can much more quickly get an accurate estimate of MMLU.
