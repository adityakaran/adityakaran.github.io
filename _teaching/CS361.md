I lead recitation sections ranging from 20-40 students per section, reviewing introductary concepts in probability and statistics. 
Since Spring 2021 I have received the [Teachers Ranked as Excellent](https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/measurement-evaluation/teaching-evaluation/teaching-evaluations-(ices)/teachers-ranked-as-excellent) distinction for every semester I have been teaching .
